### [Welcome](/)

Welcome to the Montaan codebase. This is a tour through the main parts of codebase to give you your bearings. You will learn enough to add backend API endpoints and frontend components.

When you come across mistakes and lacking information, edit the [.tour.md](/.tour.md) file for the section by clicking "Edit" button.

Let's start our tour by having a quick look at the main sections of the codebase. Click "Next" to continue.

### [Backend](/backend)

The backend is a Node.js + PostgreSQL app built using Qframe and Quickgres. The [config.js](config.js) file is the main entry point for the backend app. It loads the user accounts API from [src/user.js](src/user.js) and the Git repo API from [src/repo.js](src/repo.js). On startup, the server brings the database schema up to date with [src/migrations.js](src/migrations.js). The server serves the API endpoints at `/_/`, e.g. to get the directory tree of a repo, you'd send a request to `/_/repo/tree`. The server serves static files from [/frontend/build](/frontend/build).

The [bin/](bin/) directory contains scripts used by the backend to clone and process Git repos. The cloned Git repos are stored in [repos/](repos/) in directories named user_name/repo_name.

[Qframe](https://github.com/kig/qframe) is a high-performance API server that provides user accounts, input validation and static file serving out of the box. [Quickgres](https://github.com/kig/quickgres) is a high-performance pipelined PostgreSQL client library with the ability to stream raw PostgreSQL protocol to an output stream. Montaan frontend parses PostgreSQL protocol client-side, making the server faster.

Let's look at the frontend next.

### [Frontend](/frontend)

The frontend is a React app written in TypeScript, built on top of Create-React-App. The source code is in [src/](src/), with static files and some scripts and workers in [public/](public/).

The source is composed of multiple small files to make the source tree easier to understand, easier to test, and to avoid merge conflicts. Ideally we'd have each function in its own file with a corresponding auto-generated test file and docs, but this is difficult to support on IDE level.

### [Frontend source](/frontend/src)

The frontend source directory is split into the main app in [Montaan/](Montaan/), global CSS definitions in [css/](css/), general-purpose libraries in [lib/](lib/), and Qframe user session management components in [qframe/](qframe/).

The entry point for the frontend app is [index.jsx](index.jsx), which starts the React app in Concurrent mode and loads [App.tsx](App.tsx). App.tsx sets up the backend API ([lib/api.ts](lib/api.ts)), manages user sessions and routing, and loads the Montaan MainApp.

### [Montaan](/frontend/src/Montaan)

The Montaan app components are in [/frontend/src/Montaan](/frontend/src/Montaan), each component in its own directory. Montaan-specific libraries are in [lib/](lib/).

### [MainApp](/frontend/src/Montaan/MainApp)

[MainApp.tsx](MainApp.tsx) is the main app screen. It loads and manages app state, passing it to its child components as props.

### [MainView](/frontend/src/Montaan/MainView)

The main view is in [MainView.tsx](MainView.tsx). The MainView component loads, initializes and updates the zoomable view in [main.js](main.js).

### [Frontend components](/frontend/src/Montaan)

The other Montaan components are [Breadcrumb](Breadcrumb) for keeping track of your navigation, [CommitInfo](CommitInfo) to display commits for the repo and files and directories in it, [Search](Search) to search through files, and [RepoSelector](RepoSelector) to import new repos and show a list of your repos.

There's also an in-progress port of MainView to react-three-fibre in [TreeView](TreeView), and a commit history scrubber prototype in [CommitControls](CommitControls).

### [Frontend scripts](/frontend)

To view the components in action, you can use Storybook by running `yarn storybook`.

To create a new component, run `yarn makeComponent MyComponent Montaan` to create `Montaan/MyComponent`. The [bin/makeComponent](bin/makeComponent) script asks you some questions to flesh out the component, then generates a component with a README, tests and a Storybook story based on [templates/Component/](templates/Component/).

The frontend has pre-commit hooks in [package.json](package.json#find/lint-staged/) to update component documentation, lint using ESLint, and format the source using Prettier.

That concludes our overview of the frontend, let's have a quick look at docs now.

### [Docs](/docs)

The docs directory doesn't actually have any documentation for the source code or the application. Instead it's filled with thoughts about and plans for the app.

### [TASKS.md](/TASKS.md)

The [/TASKS.md](/TASKS.md) file keeps track of the state of improvements for the app.

### [Research](/research)

The research directory is for prototypes and experiments to improve commit velocity or the app.

### [The end](/)

And that concludes our tour. Hope you have a better understanding of the Montaan codebase now. Feel free to take this tour again by navigating to the root of the repo and clicking on the Tour button.
