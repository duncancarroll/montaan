### [Frontend tour](/frontend)

Welcome to the Montaan frontend tour.

### [src](/frontend/src)

This is where the source lives.

### [public](/frontend/public)

This is the place for static files, Web Workers and some third-party scripts.

### [bin](/frontend/bin)

You can see some component creation helpers here. They create components and maintain the documentation.

### [Storybook](/frontend/.storybook)

We're using Storybook to develop and showcase components in isolation. If you want to see what the different components look like, run `yarn storybook`.

### [Montaan](/frontend/src/Montaan)

This is where the main app source lives. You'll be mostly working here.

### [QFrame](/frontend/src/qframe)

These are for user session management, auth, signup, activation, recovery, etc.
