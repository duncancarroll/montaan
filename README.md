# Misty

Misty is a filesystem tree visualizer.

It displays the filesystem as an easy-to-understand 2D hierarchy, with folders surrounding their contents.

Misty wants to display the contents of individual files too. Can you help?


## The focused project description

- Understand a new project quickly (even old projects are new after a while - you forget how they work)
- See who is working on what

## VR/AR management

- Hierarchies as 3D objects, more natural feel, easier to understand and work with
- So coooool! Double-mondo radicalissimo!


## Organization chart visualization

- What are the teams
- Who is working on what
- What other teams are working on similar things
- What expertise exists inside the organization, how to bring that to bear on the important problems


## Visualize analytics, visitor flow

- Analytics events clustered as different types of hierarchies
- Link to users
- User movement traces, focus on success event analysis, failure event analysis -- what leads someone to buy, what is the route they take
