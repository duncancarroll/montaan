What is this?
---

A file manager that makes complex projects easier to understand.

In existing managers, project file paths are like street addresses & navigating the file system is like telling a taxi driver which way to go. This file manager is like a map.

Flexible backends: Local disk, Dropbox, Google Drive. Add value with proprietary stuff that makes your projects easier to manage: organization, connectivity & look customizations.

On Google Drive, show activity in the structure: who is editing what, where is that, what is shared with who.

VR version for productivity in virtual reality.


Think iOS Photos vs Finder. Photos makes your camera roll easier to understand and manage.
