### Tasks

[] Add line:column to search index
[] Highlight search hit line
[] Highlight search found token
[] Pipeline text model creation to avoid frame stutter (probably coming from shader compile / geometry creation)
[] Different representation for zoomed-out-text (solid lines minimap)
[] Sparkling precious particle diamonds like on Precious Nature map
[] Fade out text before hiding it
[] Handle unlimited number of lines by rendering only a portion
[] Output a 3D model for rendering with a path tracer
[] Use scroll for lateral navigation
[] In text view, constrain scroll to up-down with snap distance to free scroll (Normally scrolls just up and down but if you go to the side enough, you unlock free scroll)
