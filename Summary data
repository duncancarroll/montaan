Summary data
===

The overview gives you high visibility to hidden parts of your projects.
What kinds of useful things could we highlight or display on the overview?

Size things by various metrics: recentness, worked on by you, file size, failing tests

Highlight things like failing tests, who is working on what, calendar dates, test coverage, files that are _different_ from the norm (e.g. emacs #autosaves# and backups~, huge generated output files, media files in source dirs, .DS_Store, files with no tests, files not referred from other files, etc.)

Summarize directories:
	- who has been working on this
	- who are the OWNERS
	- how recently has this been worked on
	- does anything refer to this directory
	- how much space does this directory take



Commit-based connections:
	- Link files together if they've been touched by the same commits
