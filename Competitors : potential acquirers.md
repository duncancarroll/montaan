Competitors / potential acquirers

- Competitors: built-in file managers with a natural monopoly (but UI that's stuck in the 80s for various reasons).

- How is this crackable? Focus on boosting projects instead of competing on the OS level. The OS utility market is a lost battle, inhabited by free software from OS vendors.

- Competitors: Project management tools like Basecamp, Slack, IRC, Twitter, Facebook. This is more of an augmenting technology that supplements their offerings.

- Google Drive, Dropbox, Microsoft Drive. They seem all focused on the infrastructure level though, and the UI level is more of a competition-matching exercise (Which is understandable, no point in taking on excess risk. Besides, the existing stuff works for the others, right?) 

- Initial expectation is that this visualizer is going to be augmentative for the online storage / collaboration providers, then become an acquisition target if there's positive press and user-love. Post-acquisition, the vis product would be silently buried after a year (cuz maintaining a <ul> is a lot less work than maintaining a system that visualizes the entire universe from atoms on up...)

- Google's online productivity suite is very good for shared documents, but rather bad for shared hierarchies. This would augment Google Drive and add value for running projects there.

- Microsoft is perhaps the most possible competitor, as they're deep into AR/VR and work applications, so they're likely to start experimenting with ways to bring your documents and projects to 3D space. Then again, they might just want to acquire the most promising competitor in the space.

- Dropbox is not really in the same market. This is augmenting their web interface.

- The VR/AR angle might be interesting for Facebook, they want people to spend more time on their properties, and the more you can get done in Facebook VR, the more ad views, the more profit.

- Most other filesystem visualizers I found are either file size visualizers, focused on local filesystems, art projects, unreadable treemaps. The problem seems to be that no-one wants to make a manager that's usable in everyday use, and when they do, they end up copying Finder.

- Google Chart API has treemaps, MS Excel has treemaps, treemaps have gained acceptance for visualizing large datasets. So this visualization is already quite familiar with users and doesn't represent a big learning hurdle. The usual treemap layout algorithm is pretty bad at making anything look comfortable, organized and understandable. By changing the layout we fix those problems.

- My treemap is blazingly fast. Render a hierarchy with half a million of objects at 60fps. Opens a lot of possibilities and changes the way you use it. When you have a fast vis that you can manipulate interactively, the vis goes from being a "special-case tool that you use to dig into things" to "your default view". Compare with Google as search box website -> as the search in your browser / phone. Facebook vs web forums.
