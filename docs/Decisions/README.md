# Decisions

The decisions folder documents the reasoning behind design decisions. If you wonder why things are how they are, see if the answer is here (and if not, raise an issue / do detective work to add the documentation here.)

The decisions change over time for various reasons. Maybe a developer had some more time and implemented a better way to do it. Maybe the underlying assumptions proved false. Maybe doing it the previous way was too much of a maintenance burden and while the new way isn't as good, it's good enough.

The documents here should only grow in size, as they are historical documentation of the design decisions taken. Obsoleted documents can be moved into a previous versions directory.
