Goals


Understand & navigate contents

[ ] Search file contents (either do server side or create compressed search index & send to client, fetch file to show search snippet)
[ ] Show current path as breadcrumb (based on full coverage dirs & larger-than-x file at center of screen)
[ ] Colored text in three bmfont
[ ] Bold text in three bmfont
[ ] Pretty-print inline code
[ ] Line numbers in inline code
[ ] tabletree.config with coordinates for dirs and files :-)

[ ] Streaming build of the tree
[ ] Rebase origin based on enclosing dir
[ ] Store start-end geo indices for each subtree so that you can slice subtrees out of the geometry & move them around
[ ] Build tree in worker to keep UI thread solid frame rate
[ ] Build inline text geometries in worker
[ ] If need be, upload geometry & textures in chunks to maintain frame rate


Visualize work done in the repo

[ ] Show authors for a file in file tree
[ ] Show commits for a file in file tree
[ ] Show commit tree next to file tree
[ ] Show author tree next to commit tree
[ ] Click author to highlight commits and files worked on by the author
[ ] Click commit to highlight author and files in the commit
[ ] Display dates in commit list, 2016-04-23_____ commit 1\n commit2\n commit3 -style


Third-party integration

[ ] Link from inline text to GitHub line number


Make cooperation as easy as possible

[ ] Structure code in an understandable, easy to work with fashion
[ ] Tests for layout algos and whatever that can be nailed down
[ ] Top-level docs (top-of-file quick read thing)
[ ] Readme with usage docs
[ ] Script to create/update repo visualization files (clone/pull repo, list files, get commit log, build file-commit index, build search index)
[ ] Make a simple API to supply & stream structures (like, imagine this is an HTML file and you're pushing in SimCity buildings)
