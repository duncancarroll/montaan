Learnings from entrepreneur / investor interviews


Minchen: 

In startup stage, no real benefit. In growing stage it's hard to make profit because you need to expand. It's a dynamic balance. If you want to make money, you stop expanding. But to build new market, you need to keep expanding, which uses up money. In a growing stage, need to set a point when the company starts making profit.

For VCs, you need to let them know that 1) it is a big market with good potential, 2) there's still room for startups, and 3) you can build the company to take it big. The VCs are looking for the next Zuckerberg, managing a 20000 people company with 100 billion market cap.


Kai:

If you take investment before you have market traction, you will have more energy on your bet so that you will be able to accelerate your growth. The drawback is that your company would be undervalued before you have any customers since the investors may not be able to assess your business model.


Luke:

We didn't need any VC money as we grew organically with customer money.


Andy:

W+W organic build with customer money. Custom.cm funded by extended family, no VC money, not profitable yet. VCs have a very accountant mindset: if I give you £100, when will you give me £200. Not thinking about the team or the business plan itself.
