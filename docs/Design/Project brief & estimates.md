Project brief & estimates

What is this?
---

A file manager that makes complex projects easier to understand.

In existing managers, project file paths are like street addresses & navigating the file system is like telling a taxi driver which way to go. This file manager is like a map.

Flexible backends: Local disk, Dropbox, Google Drive. Add value with proprietary stuff that makes your projects easier to manage: organization, connectivity & look customizations.

On Google Drive, show activity in the structure: who is editing what, where is that, what is shared with who.

VR version for productivity in virtual reality.


Think iOS Photos vs Finder. Photos makes your camera roll easier to understand and manage.



Second stage:

Your information dashboard. See everything that's going on at a glance, every time you open a new browser tab / go to device lock screen / home screen / step into your car. I want you to want this to be the first thing you see each time you use your device [because it shows you what you were thinking, what is the state of your world, what's happening and what you should be doing next].





1. Filesystem structure visualizer
	- [x] Build a model from list of files
	- [x] [x] Render 1 Mtri geometry + screenful of text at different font sizes
	- [ ] Color files and dirs based on user tags
	- [x] Show thumbnails for files
	- [x] [ ] Be able to zoom into the geometry / blow up parts of it
	- [x] Run whole thing at 60 fps
	- [ ] Streaming geometry build so that the first things appear in 100 ms
	- [ ] Cached geometry & renders so that the previous state appears instantly and updates as changes stream in
	- [ ] Dynamic geometry to maintain framerate and visualization depth

	How?
	- [x] Raw geometry with vertex colors
	- [x] Glyph-based text renderer
	- [x] UI raycasting against the hierarchy.
