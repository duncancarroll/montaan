We can't offer a free service, we're not tax-funded.

There are five ways you can pay us.

1. The simplest and easiest way is to pay us in money. We use the money to pay for our costs and to improve your service.
2. Pay us in labor. Grab one of the issues on our issue tracker and work on that to receive platform credits.
3. Buy labor. Pay us to create issues on our issue tracker.
4. Buy advertisements. This will get you viewers for your ads along with platform credits.
5. Pay by viewing advertisements. You'll have to complete a 15-minute ad-viewing block per day where you watch adverts and answer a small quiz after each ad to verify that you've viewed it. There are no ads on the service itself, just in the payment system.
