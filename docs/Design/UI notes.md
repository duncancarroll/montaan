UI notes

- Dark background is not inviting, especially as it's not accented by glosses and colors
- Small font size labels are not easily readable 
- Pinch zoom feels unstable (jitter caused by the 2-finger centerpoint pan, exaggerated zoom at end of pinch)
- File & folder coloring is not very helpful for source directories
	- Different PLs should look different
	- Different doc types should look different
	- Icons for different types of files
- No tools to create, delete and edit files and folders
- No tools to select files and folders
- Float jitter when zooming close on MacBook Air :-(
