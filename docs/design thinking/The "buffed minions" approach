The "buffed minions" approach
===

First build small quick data sources to render all kinds of datasets in Tabletree.
These are the minions. None of these are very impressive on their own.
When you put them all together, it feels a bit more impressive, but not very much.

	- Bookmarks
	- Mobile apps
	- Git repos
	- Files
	- Custom sources

Next start making the Tabletree core better, boosting all the existing data sources.
Now they all suddenly get more impressive, and the combined view is very impressive.

	- Rendering thumbnails
	- Rendering full views of source code
	- Streamed builds
	- Multi-table builds and views
	- Links between tables
