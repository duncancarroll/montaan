To make beautiful software, you need to enable rapid visual iteration.

Visual iteration = Change the look of the app, keep the improved parts and discard or revert the parts you don't like.

This requires working with artist tools to tap into existing workflows of creating beautiful things.
Your software needs to reimplement parts of the art tool to reproduce the output.

Mismatches between art tool output and your software's reimplementation slow down art iteration speed:
The artist has to constantly check that art changes are rendered correctly in terms of look and performance.

Existing art tools have a high quality UIs for producing visuals, making full reimplementation a lot of work.
In a perfect world, your software has a built-in best-in-class art tool that gives the artist a real-time way to change the look of your software with WYSIWYG look and performance.

In the real world, you will end up either with a mediocre art tool or you need to tailor your software to work with an existing art workflow.

Building your software around Blender wouldn't be a bad idea, as long as the real-time performance of Blender can match your app's needs.
