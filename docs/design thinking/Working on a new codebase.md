Working on a new codebase
===

The way I work on a new codebase is by:
	
	1. Get it to compile.

	2. Browse the code structure to get a rough understanding on how it's laid out

		2.1. Browse the source tree to see *what filenames* there are
		2.2. Skim the source code of *interesting files* by looking at the *data structure definitions* and *function names & signatures*
		2.3. Skim through *all the files* one by one *really quickly*
		2.4. *Search the source* to find *function definitions* & *examples of use* 

	3. Change something small. See if it compiles.

	4. *Focused full reading of a file* to gain a fuller understanding of the things surrounding the modified bit.
