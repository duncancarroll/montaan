Labor system

Why?
    - The project requires a large number of labor hours.
    - Payment by money is not scalable across income levels and tasks.
    - Microtransactions are too expensive.
    - Ad labor is too cheap and can't handle most tasks.

Issues with time tracking, verification, acceptance
PeopleOS - project map, project threads, project tasks, resources.
Take something that works well already, attach credit & payment system.
