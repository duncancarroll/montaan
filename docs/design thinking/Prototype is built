Prototype is built.

Let's market it.

Set up domain with the product, start getting feedback from users. Target: Proggit, HN, Twitter, GPlus, whatever dev pals exist.

If it's approaching any kind of popularity, think about who would like our cooperation enough to be willing to pay for it.

Ask those guys if they'd pay for our cooperation. If not, ask other guys (and adjust method of cooperation to fit them better). Repeat until succeed or run out of money.





Design for the product:

- Infrastructure project, like Google.
